### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**austinh98/austinh98** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding projects to expland my knowledge
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the basics. Took a few classes but still need a helping hand
